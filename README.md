Have you ever wanted to use the timer from Pizza Time in other tasks? When you have a homework due in 2 hours and you need inspiration?
Pizza Timer does just that.

Pizza Timer is a little widget for your desktop that accurately recreates the timer from Pizza Tower during Pizza Time. Music and everything!
Pizzaface is coming!

Just like in the game, if Pizza Time is over, Pizzaface will spawn and start chasing you, but instead of chasing Peppino, it'll chase your mouse!

Be careful of Pizzaface, because it'll send your computer to sleep if he manages to catch you, so make sure you finish your tasks in time!
Fully customizable!

    You can modify exactly how long you want Pizza Time to last, from the hour to the second.
    If you only want the visuals and not the music, you can disable it from the John menu.
    If you're scared about what Pizzaface can do to your computer, you can disable "DreamTime" so it only closes the application when it catches you.

Pizza Timer is Open Source

If you know how to code in Godot (C#), you can modify the timer to your liking! You want to make that instead of hibernating your computer when Pizzaface catches you, it RickRolls you? If you know how to code it, you can!
